**FFStudio** is a modern, cross-platform desktop application for visually designing, executing, and managing complex FFmpeg video/audio processing workflows. It provides a graphical interface to build, preview, and run FFmpeg command pipelines using a node-based editor, timeline, and integrated player.

## App Overview

FFStudio is designed to make advanced FFmpeg usage accessible and visual. Instead of writing complex command lines, users can:

- **Build processing pipelines** by connecting nodes representing inputs, filters, codecs, and outputs.
- **Manage multiple workflows** for different tasks (compression, extraction, conversion, etc.).
- **Preview and fine-tune** segments using a timeline and player.
- **Execute and monitor** FFmpeg jobs with real-time feedback and logs.

### Main UI Areas

- **Top Bar:** App title, tab navigation (Graph, Player, Logs).
- **Main Area:**
  - **Graph:** Node-based editor for building FFmpeg graphs.
  - **Player:** Video/audio player with timeline and segment controls.
  - **Logs:** Execution and debug logs.
- **Right Sidebar:** Workflow management (list, add, edit, delete, select, execute).
- **Modals:** For workflow creation/editing and loading/progress feedback.

---

## User Workflow

1. **Create a Workflow:**
   - Click "New Workflow" in the sidebar.
   - Enter a name, FFmpeg binary path, optional environment variables, and description.
   - FFStudio parses the FFmpeg binary and auto-generates available nodes (filters, codecs, etc.).

2. **Build a Processing Graph:**
   - Drag nodes (inputs, filters, codecs, outputs) onto the canvas.
   - Connect nodes to define the processing pipeline.
   - Configure node properties (e.g., filter parameters, codec options).

3. **Select and Edit Workflows:**
   - Switch between workflows using the sidebar.
   - Edit or delete workflows as needed.

4. **Preview and Edit Segments:**
   - Use the timeline to select, label, and manage video/audio segments.
   - Preview segments in the integrated player.

5. **Execute the Graph:**
   - Click "Execute Graph" to run the FFmpeg pipeline.
   - Monitor progress and logs in real time.
   - Cancel or stop processing if needed.

6. **Review Logs:**
   - View detailed logs for each execution.
   - Export logs for troubleshooting or record-keeping.

## Detailed App Description

**FFStudio** is a visual FFmpeg workflow designer and executor. It bridges the gap between FFmpeg’s powerful but complex CLI and the needs of video/audio professionals, educators, and hobbyists who want to automate and experiment with media processing.

### Key Concepts

- **Workflows:** Named, reusable sets of FFmpeg processing steps, each with its own configuration and environment.
- **Node Graph:** Each workflow is a directed graph of nodes (inputs, filters, codecs, outputs) representing FFmpeg operations.
- **Timeline:** Lets users select, label, and manage time-based segments for precise editing and preview.
- **Player:** Integrated video/audio player for instant feedback.
- **Logs:** All actions and FFmpeg output are logged for transparency and debugging.

### ⚠️ FFmpeg Usage & License

This project does **not** bundle or link FFmpeg — it simply invokes a user-supplied FFmpeg binary via subprocess.

FFmpeg is licensed under **LGPL v2.1+**, though some optional parts are under **GPL v2+**. 
Because we don’t distribute or modify FFmpeg, its licensing obligations don’t apply to our own code.
